 ### <h2> Well this is awkward... </h2>



<p> After fully learning the basics of Web Development and becoming comfortable with JavaScript, I consistently found myself pondering "What's next?". I mean I learned the basics all the day up to JavaScript, but those are clearly not the only tools a talented web developer uses to build such awesome webpages. It has always been very apparent to me that everyone isn't just building these websites and all the fancy bells and whistles from *scratch*, so what ARE they using? This is what led me to a fork in the road, choosing a "Stack". </p>
