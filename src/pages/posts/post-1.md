### Welcome to my new blog

The dust is still settling and there isn't a real timeline where this dust will ever **truly** settle. But my blog is finally here! 

The current plan for this blog is to document my journey through web development. I've got plenty of ideas that I am excited to share and the process of bringing these ideas to life will come with its own set of challenges.  

### Wait... Who am I?    

Oh... right... you have no idea who I am or what to expect from my creations.   

My name is Michael, I am 29 years old and have dabbled in web development for *years* now, but have recently decided to take it more seriously for just shy of 2 years. University is expensive, so while I have taken a few Comp Sci classes, most of what you will see in my projects is self taught. 

If you explore my projects, you will (hopefully) notice a pattern. I have a longing for the return of the 90's. Shopping malls, VHS tapes, websites, all these things just had so much more personality. 

My goal with any of my projects is to capture that nostalgic feeling in a more modern package. With that being said, I am still trying to capture this vibe more consistently. So please bear with me while I try to hone my own unique theme.
